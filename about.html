                                <p>Founded in 2030 by Logan Brian, our company has been actively building and remodeling homes all across the region. We are set and determined to give you an experience that you will never forget, your first moments in your home are made with us and we believe a refreshing start is essential in turning a house into your very own home. </p>
                                <p class="mb-0">
                                    Logan started his journey studying at Brigham Young University where he originally planned on majoring in business. After his first year of college, Logan decided to serve a church mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints where he served in Richmond, Virginia and Cali Colombia. During that time he realized his true passion was homes. </p>
                                    <br>
                                <p>This passion started from a young age when his parents would take him and his siblings to home shows where he developed a true love for detail, quality, and the art of home design. Upon returning from his church mission he changed majors to construction management where he graduated and followed his dream of starting his own custom home building company. </p>
